INTERESTS

Worldline GmbH - Kiel
Design and development of an IOT
infrastructure -for the backend of mobile
applications
Design of the µ-service system architecture for
the backend. Development of several µServices with RESTful APIs (Spring-Boot), via
which the mobile applications (iOS, Android)
synchronize the data generated by the user.
The API can only be called by authorized clients,
so
Spring
security
was
used
for
authentication/authorization.
The data was persisted in a PostgreSQL as well
as in a MongoDB.

LANGUAGES

Development of NLP, NLU and NLG for a
chatbot - SEMMI (socio-empathic humanmachine interaction).
Evaluation of natural language information
provided by users through files via the REST
APIs (Spring-Boot-MVC/Java11). Subsequent
extraction and (semantic, syntactic and
content) validation of these files.

FraRota (Non Profit Project)
Android application for duty roster scheduling
Development of an Android application for the
visualization as well as scheduling of the duty
rosters of the employees of the ground
handling services of Fraport AG. Employees can
provide their annual schedules to the app via
the Android application. The app sends this file
to the frarota-service web application, which is
hosted on Heroku. The service extracts the
content and sends it back to the app in the form
of a JSON file. The app transfers the content of
the JSON to the smartphone's calendar. The
data is then persisted in the SQLite database for
history purposes.
