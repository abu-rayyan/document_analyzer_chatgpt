Worldline GmbH - Kiel
Design and development of an IOT
infrastructure -for the backend of mobile
applications
Design of the μ-service system architecture for
the backend. Development of several μ-
Services with RESTful APIs (Spring-Boot), via
which the mobile applications (iOS, Android)
synchronize the data generated by the user.
The API can only be called by authorized clients,
so Spring security was used for
authentication/authorization.
The data was persisted in a PostgreSQL as well
as in a MongoDB.
The μ-services were built and deployed using
GitLab CI/CD. Development of the individual
pipelines and the installation/configuration of
GitLab Runners.
Other tools:
Java-17, JUnit, Maven, JPA(Hibernate),
Swagger, Postman, Linux, SCRUM, JIRA,
OAuth2, Keycloak

HanseMerkur - Hamburg
Development of an API for the management of insurance data
A RESTful API was developed using Spring-Boot(Java17), via which insurance data is managed by internal applications/processes. The data was stored in the Oracle DB and passed on to other processes through defined stored procedures.
The API could only be accessed by authorized clients, OAuth2 and Keycloak were used for this purpose.
The application was built in GitLab CI/CD as Docker images and deployed to OpenShift using Helmcharts.
More tools:
Swagger, OpenAPI, Junit, Maven, Postman
08/2021 - 12/2021
Coneva GmbH - Munich
Development of an IOT cloud application (MS Azure) for the analysis of energy consumption.
Development of various microservices using Spring-Boot/Cloud (Java11) for consuming events that are published to dedicated platforms (Event Hub, Chain2Gate) using various protocols such as MQTT, Chain2 and DECT. Responsible for deployment via Helm charts (CI/CD Azure Pipelines, Docker) and monitoring of individual pods (K8s).
Convert and interpret the events and persist the data in a relational database (PostgreSQL, Flyway).
Provisioning of the interpreted data using a RESTful API. Unit and regression testing using Junit5. Visualization of data via Grafana.

Deutsche Bahn AG - Frankfurt am Main
Development of NLP, NLU and NLG for a chatbot - SEMMI (socio-empathic human-machine interaction).
Evaluation of natural language information provided by users through files via the REST APIs (Spring-Boot-MVC/Java11). Subsequent extraction and (semantic, syntactic and content) validation of these files.
Creation and identification of skills by connecting NLU cloud providers (IBM Watson cloud). Managing and persisting the skills in MongoDB. Providing a REST API for inferencing the information entered by the user. Automated API testing via Postman (Newman).
Besides the typical developer tasks, I was very involved in requirements management and architecture decisions. Requirements were submitted to the team via the JIRA board as stories. The architecture as well as the APIs were approached according to the paradigm DDD (Domain-Driven-Design).

FraRota (Non Profit Project)
Android application for duty roster scheduling
Development of an Android application for the visualization as well as scheduling of the duty rosters of the employees of the ground handling services of Fraport AG. Employees can provide their annual schedules to the app via the Android application. The app sends this file to the frarota-service web application, which is hosted on Heroku. The service extracts the content and sends it back to the app in the form of a JSON file. The app transfers the content of the JSON to the smartphone's calendar. The data is then persisted in the SQLite database for history purposes.
